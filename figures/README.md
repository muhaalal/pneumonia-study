### Figure 1: Confusion Matrix
Confusion matrix summarizing model performence on the validation set, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for pneumonia classification.

### Figure 2: False Positive #1
Pediatric chest X-ray incorrectly classified as pneumonia. Motion blur, low contrast, and pediatric anatomy likely contributed to the error.

### Figure 3: False Positive #2
False positive caused by diffuse gray regions and acquisition artifacts, which resemble pneumonia-like opacities.
